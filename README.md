# libGDX Tapping Demo
Basic tapping testing in libGDX.

This application has a couple objects that will keep track of how many times they've been tapped.

This code has become part of [my general libGDX Demo project](https://github.com/JamesSkemp/strivinglife-libgdx-demos), and is specifically part of the [Tapping Demo](https://github.com/JamesSkemp/strivinglife-libgdx-demos/blob/master/core/src/com/jamesrskemp/strivinglifelibgdxdemos/screens/TappingDemoScreen.java).
